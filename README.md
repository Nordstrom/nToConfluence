# Stash To Confluence

## Overview
Stash kinda stinks when it comes to hosting documentation for your project. Well, ok, it is almost completely lacking in that area.

The Solution: Upload your source-controlled documentation into confluence. This can be done as part of your CD valuestream, or on a seperate git post-commit hook.


## Prereqs:
1. Ruby 1.9.3
2. Install the redcarpet, faraday, and xmlrpc gems
